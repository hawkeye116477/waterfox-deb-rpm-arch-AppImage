Package: waterfox-g4-kpe
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: fonts-lyx, pulseaudio, kwaterfoxhelper, waterfox-g4-wayland, ffmpeg
Provides: www-browser, gnome-www-browser, waterfox-g4
Description: Customizable privacy-conscious web browser with primary support for webextensions and better integration with KDE
 Waterfox focuses on giving users choice. The browser is focused on power users, which lets you make the important decisions. There is no plugin whitelist (meaning you can run Java Applets and Silverlight apps), you can run whichever extensions you like (including modified bootstrapped add-ons that can completely change functionality of the browser) and absolutely no data or telemetry is sent back to Mozilla or the Waterfox project.
 .
 Waterfox is powered by Mozilla Firefox source code.
 .
 NOTE 1: Package contains integration improvements for KDE made by openSUSE, but works good also on other desktop environments and KDE Plasma integration features may not work if kwaterfoxhelper isn't installed. For better integration recommended is also installing plasma-browser-integration package together with Plasma Integration extension.
 .
 NOTE 2: Language packs are available as separate packages to install from apt repository!
