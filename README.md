------
### Note 1: KPE means KDE Plasma Edition, but package is compatible with other DE also and doesn't depend on KDE libs. Hovewer for KDE I recommend installing package waterfox-classic-kde, which also installs other depends required for proper working of KDE integration features.

### Note 2: Grabbing packages directly doesn't always work without errors. If you got error about unmet depends, then  you need to lookup what depends it needs (see control file for package), then download and install them manually or just do the step with adding repository instead of.

### Note 3: Language packs are available as separate packages to install from apt repository! You can also download and install it directly from [download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hawkeye116477:/waterfox/xUbuntu_18.04/all](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hawkeye116477:/waterfox/xUbuntu_18.04/all).
