.SH NAME
waterfox-classic \- customizable privacy-conscious web browser with primary support for legacy extensions and secondary support for webextensions

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B waterfox-classic
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIURL\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Waterfox focuses on giving users choice. The browser is focused on power users, which lets you make the important decisions. There is no plugin whitelist (meaning you can run Java Applets and Silverlight apps), you can run whichever extensions you like (including bootstrapped add-ons that can completely change functionality of the browser) and absolutely no data or telemetry is sent back to Mozilla or the Waterfox project.
