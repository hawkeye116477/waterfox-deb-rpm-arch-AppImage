waterfox (56.2.13-0) obs; urgency=medium
    * Updated Gecko Media Plugin components

        - Waterfox now supports the latest version of the Widevine CDM (v10). This should last for a while until Google sunsets this version.
        - A few memory leaks were fixed due to this upgrade.

    * Upgraded from Widevine CDM 1.4.9.1088 to Widevine CDM 4.10.1440.19.
    * Upgraded from OpenH264 1.6 to OpenH264 1.8.1.

        - This should result in less crashing and better performance

    * Support filtering streaming response data via webRequest API
    * Support access keys in extension menus
    * User agent overrides are now much easier to add - with the options to have an automatic updating list depending on how users feel about this.
    * If upgrading from previous versions of Waterfox, you will be asked to re-enable DRM. After re-enabling, if videos with DRM do not work please restart Waterfox and videos should start to work again.
